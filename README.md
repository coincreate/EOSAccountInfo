# EOS Account Analyzer

This project acts as part of a data pipeline that feeds https://www.eossnapshots.io

The application takes as input a flat list of account names. It then:  
1. Fetches account information for each account
2. Creates a CSV of the accounts and the respective balances. 

## Installation


1. Install .NET core on your OS (Yes, this really works on Linux, and macOS) - easy to follow instructions can be found here
https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started

2. Clone the supporting EOSDotNet project, this is used by the application
```
git clone https://github.com/eosnewyork/EOSDotNet.git
cd /EOSDotNet
./build
```

3. Clone the application repo
```
git clone https://github.com/eosnewyork/EOSAccountInfo.git
cd EOSAccountInfo
./build
```

TODO: A note to reader .. it's planned to make EOSDotNet a submodule of EOSAccountInfo so that you don't need to check out and compile two different projects. 

### usage

Simply running ./EOSAccountAnalyzer.sh will output help.

Currently two commands are supported Expand and Compare. Only the "Expand" command is suggested for use at this time. 

```
./EOSAccountAnalyzer.sh Expand -h
```
